# Broadway-LionKing-Analysis
Data Science &amp; ML Project to analyse the relation between the release of the lion king movie and it's broadway counterpart.
Also, to develop an ML model, trained on data preceding the movie release to predict movie prices which would have been the case had the movie not been released. And further deriving insights from this prediction and the real-world prices.
Data collection decided to be done using Selenium.
